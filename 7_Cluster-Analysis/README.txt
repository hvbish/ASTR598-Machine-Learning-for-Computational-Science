1. Run projectionplot.py, which will read in iris.data and output projectionplot.pdf. The output file is a projection plot of Petal length vs. Petal width for the three species of Iris.
1. Run parallelplot.py, which will read in iris.data and output parallelplot.pdf. The output file is a parallel coordinates plot for the three species of Iris.

(b) If there are N attributes for a data set, there are N(N-1)/2 different projection plot attribute combinations possible.
