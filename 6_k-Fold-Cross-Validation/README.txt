1. Run crossvalidate5.py, which will read in data.out (produced in HW1 part (c)) and output crossvalidate5.out. The output file contains the average mean squared error for k-fold cross-validation of the data with k=5.


(b) If I did not know how the data was generated, I might use a higher-order polynomial as my model, keeping in mind that overfitting could increase the MSE instead of decrease it in addition to adding complexity to the calculation. Alternatively, I might plot my data first and make a guess by eye as to what form the model should take.
(c) Average MSE = 0.010007
